This repo contains the code needed for processing and analyzing CYGNSS Raw IF Collections

## Repo Contents

### Documentation
Instructions for building the C code and an example of how to perform the processing on a Raw IF collection

### Makefile Build C
C code and Makefile for processing the binary Raw IF files. Instructions for how to create the build environment to build the code can be found in the 'documentation' directory

### Post-processing Script
Matlab/Octave code for analyzing on the results of the C code


## Input Data Files
CYGNSS Raw IF files that are used as input for this processing can be downloaded from the PO.DAAC at [https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/CYGNSS_L1_RAW_IF](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/CYGNSS_L1_RAW_IF)
