## CYGNSS Raw IF Processing Code
This repo contains the code needed for processing and analyzing CYGNSS Raw IF Collections. The top level contains some documents explaning how the various programs work together. The processing consists of C code for processing the binary files and Matlab/Octave code for post-processing on the results.

CYGNSS Raw IF files can be downloaded from the PO.DAAC at [https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/CYGNSS_L1_RAW_IF](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/CYGNSS_L1_RAW_IF)
